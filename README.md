WB-Starter
==========

My personal framework for front-end development includes some SASS, HTML, and JS snippets that I use on a regular basis. This framework is built using NPM, Gulp, and Webpack and it is meant to be pulled apart or modified for the project at hand. By changing settings in the `package.json` file, this can be used for one-page landing pages, as well as used in full-fledged CMS themes.

This is here for my own storage, but please [let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions](https://github.com/wbrowar/WB-Starter/issues).

## Installation
NOTE: these instructions are for a Mac. Commands for PC or Linux might be slightly different.

### Setting Up for the First Time
1. Clone the repo into your site's root folder. You may move your `_source` and `_build` folders if needed
2. Install [Node](http://nodejs.org/) (requires v7+)
3. Make sure Ruby is installed, then install [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) by running the command `gem install sass`
4. If you don't have Homebrew, you can install it using this command: `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
5. Install ImageMagick, run this command: `brew install imagemagick`
6. Run `npm install -g gulp-cli`.
7. Go to your site's root folder and run the command: `npm install`

### Setting Up Each Project
1. In Terminal, `cd` to your project root
2. Run `npm install`
3. Update the `package.json` file to fit your project's needs. See `package.json` below
4. Run `npm run setup` to perform the default task and to do an initial setup

---
## When to Use What
### Beginning a project
- When starting a project, run the helper task, `npm run list`, to see what commands are available.
- Run `npm run setup` at the beginning of the project to pull together template files based on the type of project your are developing. In this task, you will be prompted to answer some questions that will customize the components and templates added to your `_source` folder. *NOTE: because this task overrides files in your `_source` folder, it should only be run once, at the beginning of a project.*
- `gulp font` can be run anytime you'd like when you need to add fonts to your project. See Using Fonts in CSS, below for configuration options.
- To make sure everything is working right, finish setting up your theme files and your `package.json` settings and run the `npm run dev` task. This will give you a good idea of any errors you might run into right off the bat. Even better, run `npm run prod` for a more thorough check.

### During Development
- Every time you begin to write code, run `npm run watch` first. This will watch the `_source` folder and update theme files as you save them.
- At any given time, run `npm run dev` to reprocess basic theme assets (JS, CSS, and images). Doing this will clean out old JS, CSS, and image files and replace them with up-to-date versions. It will also do a quick update of templates files (in the `_html` directory).

### Staging and Testing
- When staging files for review or testing, run `npm run prod`—every time—before deploying to a staging server. `npm run prod` includes extra tasks, such as Babel transpiling and uglification of Javascript files. While these may not be needed for better performance on a staging server, these tasks might slightly change the code enough to cause bugs to appear.

### Going Live
- When preparing to go live, run the `npm run prod` task. This will increase the version number in the `package.json` file, which will cause cache-busting to occur on static files that are loaded using version number parameters.
- Running `npm run prod` cleans out all CSS, JS, SVG, and image files and replaces them with fresh builds.
- `npm run prod` also creates favicons, adds Critical CSS, processes SVG icons and processes template files.

---
## Theme Components
### SCSS Framework
- In `_source/scss` there are a several files with underscores in front. These all get compiled into `app.css`, by default.
- Sass will compile all `.scss` files that do not contain an underscore in front of the filename.
- Files are organized into folders:
  - `automated` – For files generated by Gulp. We can assume these will update on their own, so we wouldn’t edit these manually.
  - `base` – Global CSS that is used across all pages of the site. Animations, variables, mixins, and global styles are all organized here so they’re in one place.
  - `compontents` – base CSS for HTML components, such as forms, buttons, tables, images, etc… These should be abstracted and modular so these elements can be dropped anywhere in the site and still look the same. Modifier classes can be used to make general adjustments within a component. One-off adjustments should be made by adding a new class to the component's wrapper and adding the adjustments to the new class.
  - `layout` – Layout areas and re-usable sections get styled here (as opposed to putting styles for these in the `base/_globals.scss`). Other layout elements can be added by just adding another .scss file here. It will automatically get compiled just by being in the folder.
  - `lib` – For any CSS that we receive from vendors (like our clients) can go here. These should not be edited by us, so it can be assumed than any file here can be updated at any time.
  - `pages` – Code specific to a particular page. If code is part of a re-usable component (like a “Meet the Team” layout that can be used on several pages), it should go in `layout`, but if it’s only used on one page (like code specific to the “Homepage”), it should go here.’
- CSS follows the [BEM naming convention](http://getbem.com/naming/) to reduce accidental mixing of styles.

#### Styling Components
- Elements with class names that are prefixed with `c_` indicate this is a CSS, JS, or Twig component that is part of the Style Inventory. Styles for components can appear in one of three places:
  - Twig components should have a handle associated with them (for example, 'button' or 'alert_bar'). The name of the `.twig` file should also be the name of the `.scss` file that styles that component.
    - The styles for `_html/components/button.twig` should appear in `_scss/components/button.scss` and the root class should be `c_button`.
  - Vue components can have styles within the component themselves OR in an `.scss` file.
    - Styles in the Vue component should be styles that would not likely be overridden. Use modifiers when possible instead of writing one-off styles when changing theme colors and spacing.
    - Styles from the Vue component are inserted as if they were a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`, so they will overwrite styles written in `app.css`.
    - Components that are lazy loaded through Webkit code splitting, that require a lot of styles, can benefit the site by lowering the size of `app.css`. This is especially helpful if the component is only used on a small number of pages.
  - Some CSS-only components could be styled within `base/_globals.scss`. This includes styles for things like general text sizes and page wrappers.

#### Using Fonts in CSS
- A `font()` mixin is available to optimize the use of custom `@font-face` fonts, and to making changes to fonts and font stacks consistent in your CSS. Here are the advantages of using this mixin:
  - Only fonts that are used within your SCSS are given a `@font-face` declaration.
  - `@font-face` declarations are only made once, on the first time that `font()` appears in SCSS. This reduces the amount of CSS code.

In your `package.json`, here are the options you can use. Options marked with ° are required:
  - °`name` – Used to identify the font when using the `font()` mixin. For example, in your SCSS you could write `@include font('avinir');`.
  - °`source` – Determines whether or not a font needs a `@font-face` declaration. Options are `system` or `fontface`.
  - °`fontFamily` – The font family used in CSS to refer to the font. If quotes are needed, use single quotes. For example: `"fontFamily": "'Avinir Next'",`
  - °`fallbackStack` – Fallbacks used in order in case the font is not loaded.
  - °`fontStyle` – CSS value for the `font-style` property. The output in CSS will be `font-style: normal;`, by default.
  - °`fontWeight` – CSS value for the `font-weight` property. The output in CSS will be `font-weight: normal;`, by default. You can use any CSS-valid value, such as `100` or `bold`.
  - `files` – Pairs up font file types and their locations. This is only applicable for fonts that need a `@font-face` declaration. In most situations, you'll want an `.eot` and a `.woff` file for cross-browser compatibility. A `.woff2` file can be included for better performance.


---
### Javascript
- All of the JS is configured to be compiled using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and then loaded using [loadjs](https://github.com/muicss/loadjs).

#### Using Webpack
For Javascript files, Webpack is used to uglify, transpile, and concatenate our files into bundles. It pulls directly from `_source/_js/` and `node_modules` and creates single Javascript files in `public/js/`.

Currently, there is one file, `app.js`, but if you need to split out code into additional bundles, you can configure Webpack in the `webpack.config.js` file. To add another Javascript file, modify the `entry` object:

```
entry: {
    app: paths.srcJs + "app.js",
},
```

Adding a line to `entry` requires that you give it a name (as the key), and point to the source file. Whatever you name the key will become the name of the bundle when it is created in `public/js/`.

When `npm run prod` is run, Webpack will know it is preparing files for release, so it will uglify your code within `plugins`.

```
plugins: (env === 'production') ? [
    new UglifyJsPlugin({
        sourceMap: true
    })
] : [],
```

You can add more plugins here, if you'd like.

### lazy.js
Include `lazy.js` into a JS document and create a new instance using `window.lazy = new Lazy(config)`.

```javascript
import lazy from 'lazy';

const config = {
    animationFunctions: {
        'fadePageBgColor': fadePageBgColor,
    },
    container: '#page',
};

window.lazy = new Lazy(config);
```

#### Lazy Loading
To use Lazy Loading for better loading performance, add the `data-lazy-load` attribute to an element. By itself, this will do nothing, but when combined with the optional attributes, below, different modifications will be made to the element.

| Attribute | Example Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data-src` | `/img/FPO.png` | Changes to the `src` attribute for `<video>`, `<audio>`, and `<img>` tags. |
| `data-srcset` | `/img/FPO.png 1x, /img/FPO@2x.png 2x` | Changes to the `srcset` tag uses in `<img>` tags. |
| `data-width` | `2048` | Setting both `data-width` and `data-height` on an element will add inline styles to the element that allow it to proportionately take up as much room as an image would in that space. This can be used for placeholder images styled in CSS. |
| `data-height` | `2048` |  |

#### On-scroll Animations
When used with no value, `data-lazy-animate` simply adds the class `animated` to an element. In your CSS, a transition or CSS animation can fire when `animated` is added. You can also register a function that can be fired by setting the name of the function to the value of `data-lazy-animate`.

| Attribute | Example Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data-lazy-animate` | **NONE** or `myFunction` | When the user scrolls to the element, a function registered in `config.animationFunctions` (see example above), will be fired. |
| `data-lazy-animate-args` | `{ "id": 23, "option": "value" }` | Arguments that will be passed into the function registered in `data-lazy-animate` as an object. |
| `data-lazy-animate-delay` | `500` | Uses `setTimeOut()` to delay the firing of a function set in `data-lazy-animate`. |
| `data-lazy-animate-reset` | **NONE** | Add this attribute to allow a JS animation to continue firing as the element re-enters the viewport. |

### scrollto.js
Include `scrollto.js` into a JS document and call the default, `scrollto()` function to init.

```javascript
import scrollto from 'scrollto';

function scrollToElement(el) {
    const elRect = el.getBoundingClientRect();
    const newY = elRect.top + document.body.scrollTop - 130;

    scrollto({ destination: newY });
}

const el = document.getElementById("section_1");
scrollToElement(el);
```

| Attribute | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `destination` | 0 | A `scrollTop` position, based on the top of the document. Leave this at `0` to go back to the top of the document. |
| `duration` | 500 | How long the animation shold take. |
| `easing` | 'easeOutQuad' | Easing function used to determine how the animation will look. Look into the `scroll.js` file to see what options are available. |
| `callback` | *undefined* | Pass in a callback function that should fire after animation is done. |

---
### Image Processing
- **_icon** SVGs will be processed differently depending on where they are located in the `_source/_icon` folder:
  - **css** All `.svg` images in the `css` folder will be base64-encoded and added using `background-image` to a file in the `_source/scss/automated/` folder, called `_icon_sprite.scss`. This will be compiled when the `sass` task is run.
  - All `.svg` files in the `_source/_icon` folder will be moved to your theme's `icon` folder so they can be linked to or embedded from the front-end.
- **_img** Images will be processed differently depending on where they are located in the `_source/_img` folder:
  - **2x** Putting 2x-resolution images in the `2x` folder will result in both a 2x image and a 1x image being placed into your `img` directory. The 2x image will be suffixed with `@2x`.
  - Images located directly in the `_source/_img`, or folders not listed above will only be minimized and moved into your theme's `img` folder.
- **_favicons** Adding a 512x512 `.png` into the `_source/_favicons` folder, and running `npm run prod`, will result in a set of meta images placed in `img/meta`. HTML for these images will be generated in `_build/html/meta.html`. This code will be included as part of the HTML build process.

---
### Gulp HTML Builder
- Uses [ejs](http://ejs.co) to process HTML files when the `npm run prod` task is run.
- Using `ejs` allows you to include files, use conditionals, and replace strings—like IDs and classes.
- There are default replacements included in the Gulpfile, and additional replacements can be added to the `ejsVars` setting in `package.json`. If the replacement is for an include, the file must be included based on the root of the `_build` folder.

---
### Style Inventory
- To get to the Style Inventory, go to `/dev/inv`
- In Craft websites, the Style Inventory section is available in `dev`, and `staging` environments and will redirect you to the home page in a `live` environment
- Components are either based on Twig, Vue components, or plain HTML patterns
- Components are separated so they can easily be moved from one project to another
- Components should be edited to meet the needs of the project
- Components that are not in use should be removed by doing the following:
  1. Delete the component example code and documentation from the Style Inventory or hide the page by removing it from the `styleTemplateSections` array in `package.json`
  2. Move the `SCSS` file that matches up with the component name to `_source/_scss/_unused` so it won't get compiled with other `CSS` code
  3. If a Vue component is no longer needed, comment out the import and remove its registration from the root Vue instance in `_source/_js/vue-components`

#### Twig Components
- Twig components are displayed by including the `macros/component.twig` macro and by calling the `c()` macro while passing in a component name and the appropriate arguments
- Each component name is matched up with the name of an `SCSS` file, found in `_source/scss/components` (unless the component doesn't require external SCSS)
- Some components are wrappers for Vue components with some Twig-based helpers
  - For example, the `image_slider` makes it easy to create common slides used in carousels, and its output is based on a `Slider.vue` component
  - Vue components can still be used in place of the Twig version when more flexibility is needed

#### Vue Components
- Vue components are split into Single File Components
- Examples in the Style Inventory show common uses of the components
  - To see more available options, open the `.vue` file used in a component and look for available `props`

  - The `slides-layout` is a JSON array that allows you to set the amount of elements per slide (the `count` property) and if you pass in a `width` property it will change the amount when the slider is above the given width
  - When the `auto-height` prop is set to `true`, the slider will now adjust it's height based on the height of the content of its slides
  - The slider will now loop between the last slide and the first slide in both directions
  - The slider uses `Hammer.js` to enable swipe on touch devices
  - Slides that are not the current, previous, or next slides are set to `visibility: invisible` so they do not appear when other slides are animating

  ```
  alias dev="npm run dev"
  alias list="npm run list"
  alias prod="npm run prod"
  alias watch="npm run watch"
  ```
- :rocket: Replaced SystemJS with Webpack

- :fire: Removed `importPageSpecificModule` function
- :fire: Deleted `_source/_js/system-config.js`
- :fire: Deleted `_source/_js/modernizr.custom.js`
- :fire: Stopped adding `.min` to uglified JS files

#### 4.7.1
- :wrench: Updated all NPM libraries. **This now requires the latest Node 7.x and all `node_modules` should be deleted and `npm install` should be run to update dependencies.**
- :wrench: Split index.html into ejs partials for better portability when creating multiple pages
- :rocket: Added an `index` section to default style inventory to explain what a style inventory does
- :wrench: Bug fixes and minor tweaks in `Gulpfile.js`

#### 4.7.0
- :rocket: Added new templates to the default style inventory
  - **Animations** - Added the option to use javascript functions when an element is scrolled into view
    - A function must be passed into the defaul `lazy()` function. Follow the example in `_source/_js/global.js`
    - Add `data-lazy-animate="animationFunction"` to call a function registered as `animationFunction`
    - Adding a pipe after the function name allows you to pass in arguments as a string. For example, `data-lazy-animate="animationFunction|Function Argument"`
  - **CSS Grid** - Added a default "Holy Grail" grid layout
  - **Icons** - Added default Social Media icons
  - **Images** - Added lazy-loading for content images and background images
  - **Media** - Added lazy-loading audio, iframe, and video files

  - **Naviagtion** - Added example of typical hamburger functionality
  - **Vue Components** - Added accordion and overlay Vue components
- :rocket: Added default function for toggling an `active` class on elements
  - To toggle an `active` class on click on an element, add the attribute `data-active-toggle`
  - To toggle an `active` class on another element, add a CSS selector to the vaulue of the `data-active-toggle` attrbiute. For example, `data-active-toggle="#mobile_nav"`
- :rocket: Added `_source/layout/_grid.scss` for all CSS Grid styles
- :rocket: Added `_source/modules/_messages.scss` to style alert messages
- :rocket: Added `_source/modules/_vue.scss` to style vue components
- :rocket: Added `_js/vue-compontents.js` to add Vue components, an event handler, and to create a root Vue Instance on the `#page` element
- :wrench: Improved style inventory styles

#### 4.5.1
- :rocket: `jsDevMode` now gets set to false when running `npm run prod`
- :rocket: `jsVersion` gets set to the package version number upon `npm run prod`, otherwise it is set to the current timestamp and files that use `<%= version %>` will be forced to reload during development
- :wrench: Added support for `.min` files in the `_js/_lib` folder
  - `.min.js` files do not get uglified or renamed. They are just moved to your `js/_lib` folder in your theme path
- :wrench: Moved SystemJS `<script>` tag, system config code, and font events code down to bottom of the `<body>` tag. I'm not sure if this will have an impact either way, but it seems like it's safe to move to speed up loading
- :rocket: Added `vue.js` to default libraries
  - Vue is not turned on by default, but it'll be there in case you'd like to use it
  - Because of the way Vue's libraries are named (dev = `.js`, prod = `.min.js`), moving only one file during `gulp first` gets messed up, so conditional loading—based on whether or not `jsDevMode` is true—makes it so development Vue is loaded via their CDN, and when `npm run prod` is run, the local, production version is used

#### 4.5.0
- :wrench: Replaced `emergence` with `scrollMonitor` for lazy loading
- :rocket: Added `_source/_js/lazy.js` to handle lazy loading
  - `lazy.js` relies on `data` attributes. See comments in the code for required attributes and data types
  - Check `lazy.js` comments for more information
- :fire: Removed webshot from `Gulpfile.js`
  
#### 4.4.0
- :rocket: Added font configuration settings to `package.json`
- :rocket: Added `gulp font` task to automate `@font-face` declarations and performance enhancements in `_source/automated/_fonts.scss`
  - Configure font settings in `package.json` and run `gulp font` anytime you update fonts you want available in the `font()` mixin
- :rocket: Added style template settings to `package.json`
- :rocket: Added files to create default style inventory sections
  - To add a style inventory section to a page, use `<%- include(styletemplate____) %>` and replace blank with name of the section. For example, to embed the icons section, use `<%- include(styletemplateicons) %>`

#### 4.3.0
- :rocket: Added `browserSync` settings to `package.json`
- :rocket: Added Browsersync support
