WB-Starter
==========

My site starter that includes a configuration from Initilizr, a CodeKit config file and some SASS, HTML and JS snippits that I use on a regular basis. Meant to be pulled apart or modified for the project at hand.

This is here for my own storage, but please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

You can make your own by [1] configuring your build here:
[http://www.initializr.com](http://www.initializr.com)

[2] buy CodeKit here:
[http://incident57.com/codekit/](http://incident57.com/codekit/)

[3] write some sweet SASS Mixins and figure out a file structure that works best for you.
